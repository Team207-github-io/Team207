#Team Charter

Our team will work together to further all members' education. The project developed by the team will not only meet all the requirements set forth by the class but will also be an excellent example of the team's abilities and skills so that the team members will look good to potential future employers or higher education programs. The team will use this project to develop our skills including software and further debugging skills. The team also wants to build a project that solves a real world problem. In order to ensure success in this objective the team will work to have all verifications done before the project is due so that we are all ready to present our work.  

By the end of this semester we expect to incorporate what we learn in class to achieve: 

Produce a product that we as a team would feel proud to display in our portfolio or to future employer 
Have a product that meets the requirements and criteria described in the project.
Have all subsystem verifications done by the time the project is due and be ready to present.
Build a product that is applicable to problems people have in the real world 
Improve programming skill sets through various applications to gain a deeper understanding of the tools used in industry. 

#Product Mission Statement

The teamâ€™s mission is to design a product that can stand out amongst our peers and demonstrate proficiency in microcontroller based projects. The design must include a microcontroller, serial communications, multiple sensors, and a motor controller to fulfill product requirements. 

To achieve this goal, the team is committed to putting forth significant time and effort to overcome the many challenges that will present themselves. Furthermore, through extensive collaboration the team will look to gain the necessary experience to work in team-based environments within the industry.

#Communication Procedures

The team will be using a text group chat and a discord server as communication channels. Text messages can be used to answer questions, discord can be used for the same purpose but text channels can be made for specific assignments. Discord can also be used for meetings through the voice channel when being in person is not necessary or possible. A google drive will also be shared with everyone in the group where assignments can be accessed and worked on. 

The group will work evenly in all assignments, a member can work on what they feel most comfortable. Any questions can be asked to the group in the decided methods of communication, this will ensure that no questions are repeated and the question is answered.


#Meeting Schedule

Our team will be meeting Mondays and Wednesdays from 1PM - 3PM every week till the end of the semester. Towards the end of the semester we will use other highlighted green sections for additional meeting times.

#Meeting Coordination

The team will use both remote and face-to-face communication methods, with a particular emphasis on face-to-face during the latter phases of the design. In order to ensure ample meeting time, the team has agreed to keep communications open through text, discord, and email for the purposes of coordination outside of class. Many of our meetings will be directly after scheduled class times; meetings that are missing a single person will still be conducted and any pertinent information will be distributed to that missing member via the aforementioned remote methods. 


#Team Coordination

The team will work together to get assignments done, it is expected by team members to finish their part before the deadline to allow time for revision. Once the assignment is done, the team will be notified to check the assignment. Once everyone is satisfied with the work done, the assignment will be submitted. When the team receives feedback on the assignment, all team members are expected to help improve the assignment.
