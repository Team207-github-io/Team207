## Final Microcontroller Choice: PIC18F27K40

The team selected to use the PIC18F27K40 as our microcontroller. This was selected over alternatives for a number of reasons. This PIC has support for both I2C and SPI allowing the team to make use of both protocols for our project. The PIC also has a large amount of program memory available which will assist during development as less time will need to be spent optimizing for storage space. This PIC is also available in both Through hole and Surface mount from Microchip as of 2/27/2023. The PIC also has a development board available for it giving the team more options for development of the team's software. This PIC is also supported in MCC Melody. There are also many application notes about using the PIC on the Microchip website. The datasheet for this PIC can be found [here](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/OTH/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/PIC18LF27_47K40-Data-Sheet-40001844E.pdf) More information can also be found on the [Microchip website.](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/PIC18F27K40) Other Microcontollers the team considered can be found in Appendix G linked below.
