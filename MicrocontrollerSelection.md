| Built-in Analog to Digital Converter?<br>How many? | 0 | 25 | 16 | 25 |
| Built-in Hardware PWM?<br>How many? | 0 | 25 | 16 | 25 |
| Built-in I2C? SPI? How many? | 13 (3 LED, 1 Button, 3 CS SPI, 2 SPI, 2 I2C, 2 UART) | 25 | 16 | 25 |
| Built-in UART? How many? | 13 (3 LED, 1 Button, 3 CS SPI, 2 SPI, 2 I2C, 2 UART) | 25 | 16 | 25 |

Choice: Option 1

Rationale: One reason why we choose this sensor is because of the output type, we need either SPI or I2C. In addition to this, we will be working with Option 1 in class, this will make it easier on the team to apply this sensor to our product.

## Hall Effect Sensor

| Solutions     | Pros          | Cons  |
| :---: | --- | ---|
| Option 1. Sensor Rotary 360deg SMD<br>MLX90316EDC-BDG-100-TU-ND<br>$6.97/each<br>[link to product](/https://www.digikey.com/short/44z2bv5z) | *SPI output<br>*Surface mount | *supply voltage 4.5-5.5V<br>*Least varying operating temperature -40C-85C |
| Option 2. Sensor Angle 360deg SMD<br>AS5600-ASOM<br>$3.46/each<br>[Link to product](/https://www.digikey.com/short/jd4n23vq) | *Least expensive<br>*Supply voltage 3.3V, 5V<br>*Surface mount | *Analog voltage for output |
|Option 3. Hall Effect Sensor Rotary Position External Magnet<br>AS5047U-HTSM<br>$13.01/each<br>[Link to product](/https://www.digikey.com/short/2twd9t7v) | *Supply voltage 3-3V-6V, 4.5V-5.5V<br>*SPI & PWM output<br>*Surface mount | *Most expensive<br>*TSSOP packaging |

Choice: Option 2: AS5600-ASOM

Rationale: This option seemed most rational because it contains most of the pros with the least amount of cons. Also able to work with different voltages and in a wide range of temperatures. This chip is also one we have worked with in the past so there's less of a learning curve.

| Additional considerations specific to<br>your project specifications (optional) | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Choice: Option 1: L9958

Rationale: The L9958 offers the most in terms of flexibility and power controls for our device. The chip is the most expensive option, but it also has the most robust SPI interface options. It also has a very high amperage output potential, allowing the team to use more powerful motors. 

## Motor

| Solutions     | Pros          | Cons  |
| :---: | --- | ---|
| Option 1.

| Option 2. Nidel Copal ROB-09238<br>$19/each<br>[datasheet](/https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/SM-42BYG011-25.pdf) | *Stepper motor gives more precise control<br>*Affordable<br>*High torque<br>*Available from reputable sources | *Little documentation on this device<br>*Extra complexity due to stepper motor features<br>*High power requirements |
| Option 3. Pololu 4798 Brushed Gearmotor<br>$22/each<br>[datasheet](/https://www.pololu.com/product-info-merged/4798)ements<br>*Does not have precise motor control options |

Rationale: For the purposes of the teamâ€™s design, the added complexity and precision 

Choice: Option 3. Pololu 4798 Brushed Gearmotorfrom the alternative motor options is not necessary. This motor fits the needs of the design as a high torque motor, and is both affordable and in high availability.

## Power Source

Choice: Option 1

Rationale: The team opted to use the AC/DC 12V power supply due to its ease of use and consistent 12V supply. The loss of portability is made up for by the convenience of not needing to replace batteries after repeated usage.

Choice: Option 1

Rationale: Option 1 has a wide voltage input which would work for our components and is available for an affordable price. By being a positive fixed type we will avoid having to use external components.
