| Option 3. TMP126NDCKR<br>$2.03 /each<br>[Link to Product](/https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TMP126NDCKR/16602367) | *Digital Output<br>*Range: -55 - 150 C<br>*Voltage 1.62 - 5.5 V<br>*One-shot, Shutdown mode, Sleep mode<br>*.8 degree Accuracy<br>*SPI output |  |

Choice: Option 1

Rationale: One reason why we choose this sensor is because of the output type, we need either SPI or I2C. In addition to this, we will be working with Option 1 in class, this will make it easier on the team to apply this sensor to our product.

## Hall Effect Sensor

| Solutions     | Pros          | Cons  |
| :---: | --- | ---|
| Option 1. Sensor Rotary 360deg SMD<br>MLX90316EDC-BDG-100-TU-ND<br>$6.97/each<br>[link to product](/https://www.digikey.com/short/44z2bv5z) | *SPI output<br>*Surface mount | *supply voltage 4.5-5.5V<br>*Least varying operating temperature -40C-85C |
| Option 2. Sensor Angle 360deg SMD<br>AS5600-ASOM<br>$3.46/each<br>[Link to product](/https://www.digikey.com/short/jd4n23vq) | *Least expensive<br>*Supply voltage 3.3V, 5V<br>*Surface mount | *Analog voltage for output |

Choice: Option 1: L9958

Rationale: The L9958 offers the most in terms of flexibility and power controls for our device. The chip is the most expensive option, but it also has the most robust SPI interface options. It also has a very high amperage output potential, allowing the team to use more powerful motors. 

## Motor

| Solutions     | Pros          | Cons  |
| :---: | --- | ---|
