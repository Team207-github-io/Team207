## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

In order to move forward with the design, the team needed to generate a list of user needs to act as a rough guideline for design perameters. The team went through various methods to generate a list of roughly 60 user needs. Firstly, the team reviewed the project requirements set by the course as a set of design constraints that acted the first series of user needs. Secondly, the team went to Amazon.com to review products that functioned as a climate control device for plants. The team found five unique products, then found 3 positive and 3 negative reviews, then proceeded to extrapolate user needs from these reviews.

After we generated the unorganized list of user needs, the team then sorted each need based on a particular classification. 
These classifcations were: Design Constraints, Design Functions, and Design Interactivity. Or simply, what does the product need to include, what can the product do, and how do users interact with the product. We then ranked these needs in order to identify which concepts to prioritize in our design moving forward. The ranking system was a simple list of ranking needs from rank 1-3, where a lower number indicated a higher priority need. An example of a high priority need would be a requirement of serial communication, while a low priority would be the use of LED lights for aesthetics. 

### Design aspects:

**Hardware / Product Design:**

System will need 2 separate serial sensors and a serial actuator using SPI or I2C. Also utilize 1 motor or linear actuator to control direction in multiple directions based on serial sensors. Powering of this system will be using at least one switching voltage regulator in the final design. 


**Software / Functionality:** 

Communication from board to web will be through WiFi. Data will be displayed to the user in real time when changes are occurring to the environment via sensors.
Interactivity & User Experience: Once the user sets the product, the product will be able to automatically adjust to the surrounding weather so that the customer does not need to manually adjust the product.

**Customization:**

 The user can set a desired output so that the product adjusts to the user's needs. The product can also come in different sizes and colors depending on the user preference.
 
**Manufacturing:**

the product will be made through a unique Printed Circuit Board that fits the sensors and actuators used in the product. There will be a casing to protect all components and make it easier to install.

**Safety:**

 Product will use correct seals if dealing with water to prevent hazards. Also will keep electrical components secured within a solid zone to prevent shortages and prevent dangerous environments. Cords or power supply will have proper hardware to ensure no user is electrocuted.
