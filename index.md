## Team Organization

### Team Charter

Our team will work together to further all members' education. The project developed by the team will not only meet all the requirements set forth by the class but will also be an excellent example of the team's abilities and skills so that the team members will look good to potential future employers or higher education programs. The team will use this project to develop our skills including software and further debugging skills. The team also wants to build a project that solves a real world problem. In order to ensure success in this objective the team will work to have all verifications done before the project is due so that we are all ready to present our work.  

By the end of this semester we expect to incorporate what we learn in class to achieve: 

Produce a product that we as a team would feel proud to display in our portfolio or to future employer 
Have a product that meets the requirements and criteria described in the project.
Have all subsystem verifications done by the time the project is due and be ready to present.
Build a product that is applicable to problems people have in the real world 
Improve programming skill sets through various applications to gain a deeper understanding of the tools used in industry. 

### Product Mission Statement

The teamâ€™s mission is to design a product that can stand out amongst our peers and demonstrate proficiency in microcontroller based projects. The design must include a microcontroller, serial communications, multiple sensors, and a motor controller to fulfill product requirements. 

To achieve this goal, the team is committed to putting forth significant time and effort to overcome the many challenges that will present themselves. Furthermore, through extensive collaboration the team will look to gain the necessary experience to work in team-based environments within the industry.  


## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

In order to move forward with the design, the team needed to generate a list of user needs to act as a rough guideline for design perameters. The team went through various methods to generate a list of roughly 60 user needs. Firstly, the team reviewed the project requirements set by the course as a set of design constraints that acted the first series of user needs. Secondly, the team went to Amazon.com to review products that functioned as a climate control device for plants. The team found five unique products, then found 3 positive and 3 negative reviews, then proceeded to extrapolate user needs from these reviews.

After we generated the unorganized list of user needs, the team then sorted each need based on a particular classification. 
These classifcations were: Design Constraints, Design Functions, and Design Interactivity. Or simply, what does the product need to include, what can the product do, and how do users interact with the product. We then ranked these needs in order to identify which concepts to prioritize in our design moving forward. The ranking system was a simple list of ranking needs from rank 1-3, where a lower number indicated a higher priority need. An example of a high priority need would be a requirement of serial communication, while a low priority would be the use of LED lights for aesthetics. 

### Design aspects:

**Hardware / Product Design:**

System will need 2 separate serial sensors and a serial actuator using SPI or I2C. Also utilize 1 motor or linear actuator to control direction in multiple directions based on serial sensors. Powering of this system will be using at least one switching voltage regulator in the final design. 


**Software / Functionality:** 

Communication from board to web will be through WiFi. Data will be displayed to the user in real time when changes are occurring to the environment via sensors.
Interactivity & User Experience: Once the user sets the product, the product will be able to automatically adjust to the surrounding weather so that the customer does not need to manually adjust the product.

**Customization:**

 The user can set a desired output so that the product adjusts to the user's needs. The product can also come in different sizes and colors depending on the user preference.
 
**Manufacturing:**

the product will be made through a unique Printed Circuit Board that fits the sensors and actuators used in the product. There will be a casing to protect all components and make it easier to install.

**Safety:**

 Product will use correct seals if dealing with water to prevent hazards. Also will keep electrical components secured within a solid zone to prevent shortages and prevent dangerous environments. Cords or power supply will have proper hardware to ensure no user is electrocuted.
