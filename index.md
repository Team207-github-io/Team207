## Team Organization

**Team Charter**

Our team will work together to further all members' education. The project developed by the team will not only meet all the requirements set forth by the class but will also be an excellent example of the team's abilities and skills so that the team members will look good to potential future employers or higher education programs. The team will use this project to develop our skills including software and further debugging skills. The team also wants to build a project that solves a real world problem. In order to ensure success in this objective the team will work to have all verifications done before the project is due so that we are all ready to present our work.  

By the end of this semester we expect to incorporate what we learn in class to achieve: 

Produce a product that we as a team would feel proud to display in our portfolio or to future employer 
Have a product that meets the requirements and criteria described in the project.
Have all subsystem verifications done by the time the project is due and be ready to present.
Build a product that is applicable to problems people have in the real world 
Improve programming skill sets through various applications to gain a deeper understanding of the tools used in industry. 

**Product Mission Statement**

The teamâ€™s mission is to design a product that can stand out amongst our peers and demonstrate proficiency in microcontroller based projects. The design must include a microcontroller, serial communications, multiple sensors, and a motor controller to fulfill product requirements. 

To achieve this goal, the team is committed to putting forth significant time and effort to overcome the many challenges that will present themselves. Furthermore, through extensive collaboration the team will look to gain the necessary experience to work in team-based environments within the industry.
