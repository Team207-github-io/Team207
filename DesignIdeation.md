Title: Design Ideation
---

## Brainstorming Stage

In order to generate as many ideas as possible, the team collectively joined a discord call and began listing off basic concepts that the design could include. These concepts were entered into a list format via a jamboard and were simply entered into the list as they were brought up. Each member attempted to contribute roughly 25 ideas, totaling at 100 ideas collectively. No team member had any specific role; each member was simply looking to add as many concepts as they could. These ideas were initially completely unorganized, as they were merely entered into the list as each person thought of the concept.

## Organization Stage

Once the list of 100 total concepts was complete, the team went through the process of organizing them based on 4 classifications. These classifications were: External Influence, Design Action/Feature, Design Aspect, and Green Concious. Each item in the list was color coded based on each classification. After each of the concepts was assigned a classification, the team then proceeded to generate design ideas based on several concepts. The goal was to include at least 8 unique concepts, with an attempt to include at least 2 from each different classification. Unfortunately, there was not enough green concious focused ideas, so the team decided to keep 8 concepts; while excluding green concious if it was deemed superfluous.

## Concept Formulation Stage

Three of our team members used the design ideas to generate rough design sketches of the proposed designs. Each sketch had core features highlighted as a means to showcase how those designs met the expectations of both the course as well as the design proposal itself. The members who created designs were Stefano, Daymon, and Ragde.
