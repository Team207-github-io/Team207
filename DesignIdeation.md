Title: Design Ideation
---

## Brainstorming Stage

In order to generate as many ideas as possible, the team collectively joined a discord call and began listing off basic concepts that the design could include. These concepts were entered into a list format via a jamboard and were simply entered into the list as they were brought up. Each member attempted to contribute roughly 25 ideas, totaling at 100 ideas collectively. These ideas were initially completely unorganized, as they were merely entered into the list as each person thought of the concept.
