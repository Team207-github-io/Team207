| Option 3. TMP126NDCKR<br>$2.03 /each<br>[Link to Product](/https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TMP126NDCKR/16602367) | *Digital Output<br>*Range: -55 - 150 C<br>*Voltage 1.62 - 5.5 V<br>*One-shot, Shutdown mode, Sleep mode<br>*.8 degree Accuracy<br>*SPI output |  |

Choice: Option 1

Rationale: One reason why we choose this sensor is because of the output type, we need either SPI or I2C. In addition to this, we will be working with Option 1 in class, this will make it easier on the team to apply this sensor to our product.

## Hall Effect Sensor

| Solutions     | Pros          | Cons  |
| :---: | --- | ---|
| Option 1. Sensor Rotary 360deg SMD<br>MLX90316EDC-BDG-100-TU-ND<br>$6.97/each<br>[link to product](/https://www.digikey.com/short/44z2bv5z) | *SPI output<br>*Surface mount | *supply voltage 4.5-5.5V<br>*Least varying operating temperature -40C-85C |
