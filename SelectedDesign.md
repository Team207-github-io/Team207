## Selected Design

After brainstorming poptential designs, we decided to keep it simple and yet keep a real world application. Meets all criteria for sensors, accuators, and communication subsystems. Based on user needs and product review we concluded that our design should be durable, efficient, and user friendly. As seen in the images below our design has a retractable mesh that acts based on reading of wind and temperature sensor.
