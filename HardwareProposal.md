## Final Hardware Implementation

# Final Schematic

In the schematic below we can see how all the subsystems are connected to each other. The PIC recieves power from the voltage regualor and is also connected to the other subsystems (temperature sensor, motor driver, and hall effect sensor). We have header pins and other compoents to make these connections possible and with the power and voltage requiered for each part.

# Final PCB Design

Once the schematic was completed, we had to think where we wanted each component on the PCB. We used both sides of the PCB so that the components are not too close too each other and it is easier to assembly. By using both sides, we could have the hall effect sensor on the upper side making it easier to mount the magnet that would povide us with values.

# Improvements

We made many imporvents from the Alpha board to the final PCB. Some of these imprivents were using both sudes of the PCB, adding vias, increasing the and thickness of the traces. All these imporovemnts were essential to have a funtioning board that could be implemented into our prototype. If we were to make a version 2 of the board, we could make a breaout board for the sensors, this would make impleneting the PCB into a prortype deign easier and cleaner. By having a breakout board, we could find a better spot for the sensors to be more accurate and easier to reach.
