## Communication Procedures

The team will be using a text group chat and a discord server as communication channels. Text messages can be used to answer questions, discord can be used for the same purpose but text channels can be made for specific assignments. Discord can also be used for meetings through the voice channel when being in person is not necessary or possible. A google drive will also be shared with everyone in the group where assignments can be accessed and worked on. 

The group will work evenly in all assignments, a member can work on what they feel most comfortable. Any questions can be asked to the group in the decided methods of communication, this will ensure that no questions are repeated and the question is answered.


## Meeting Schedule

Our team will be meeting Mondays and Wednesdays from 1PM - 3PM every week till the end of the semester. Towards the end of the semester we will use other highlighted green sections for additional meeting times.

## Meeting Coordination

The team will use both remote and face-to-face communication methods, with a particular emphasis on face-to-face during the latter phases of the design. In order to ensure ample meeting time, the team has agreed to keep communications open through text, discord, and email for the purposes of coordination outside of class. Many of our meetings will be directly after scheduled class times; meetings that are missing a single person will still be conducted and any pertinent information will be distributed to that missing member via the aforementioned remote methods. 


## Team Coordination

The team will work together to get assignments done, it is expected by team members to finish their part before the deadline to allow time for revision. Once the assignment is done, the team will be notified to check the assignment. Once everyone is satisfied with the work done, the assignment will be submitted. When the team receives feedback on the assignment, all team members are expected to help improve the assignment.
